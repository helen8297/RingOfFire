### Tasked with creating a game for people to play during the coronavirus lockdown, myself and my teammate Murray decided to build an online version of the much loved, classic drinking game, Ring of Fire! We used React to build this application and it is hosted with Netlify.

## How to play
1) Click the link above and either screenshare with your friends on a video call or play in real life (after lockdown!)
2) Make sure everyone has a drink. (Alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
3) Add all player names.
4) Choose a card. The player's name whose turn it is will will yellow, they must follow the given instructions.
5) If a '2' card is shown, you can use the 'choose random player' feature to pick who drinks. 
6) If people leave the game, click the cross next to their name to remove them from play.
